# ExchangeRanking
This a small python script that connects to a Google Sheet on which the data from a Google Form are saved.

The goal is to create, every day, a ranking of the students from Bocconi University enrolled in BIEF-Econ and BESS courses for the exchange program of the third year. This ranking is sent to my email and then I'll forward it to the whatsapp group with all the people interested.
